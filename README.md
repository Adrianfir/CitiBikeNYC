# CitiBikeNYC
## A deep analysis of the bike sharing network of New York City
The data can be downloaded from the <a href="https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data">official CitiBike webiste</a>. There’s a file for each month, a zip file containing a single csv file. The files are in chronological order starting in 2013, so to find the recent ones you have to scroll down. Don’t scroll down all the way to the bottom though; the files with JC in the name are for Jersey City, not New York.
